# GregNothing

_A zero ore generation GregTech based modpack for Minecraft 1.12.2!_

## About

This pack is all about automation and building in a vanilla world, with no set end-goal.

In this pack you will go through the various stages of GregTech's progression
system, with other tech mods such as Forestry, Immersive Engineering, Industrial
Foregoing, and NuclearCraft to provide additional options for automation and building.

To assist your journey into automation, there is a quest book which will guide
you on how to set up fully automatic production lines for various resources.

_Note:_ Many recipes you may know have been changed for this modpack, most
often to provide a deeper integration with the modlist used, but sometimes to ease
your journey through the world of automation.

## The World

World generation has been dialled back to a very bare and minimal state. There
are no ores to find and nothing but vanilla trees and plants in the world.

Despite this, Pam's Harvestcraft, Rustic, and many various ores are available
through alternative means, starting with Ex Nihilo Creatio's familiar sieving
system. Once a certain technological level has been achieved, you can use
Immersive Engineering's multiblock Excavator to acquire resources and even
the Industrial Foregoing Laser Drill.

_Note:_ It is strongly recommended to play without structures to get the full
experience intended in the modpack. There is no requirement to go to neither the
Nether or the End, although both of these places may provide different resources
with either the Excavator or Laser Drill.

## Key Changes for Specific Mods

### Vanilla

Normal tools (axes, shovels, hoes, pickaxes, swords) are disabled and Tinkers'
Construct tools are instead intended.

### Applied Energistics 2

**TODO**: Cables are replaced with Immersive Engineering style cables.

### JEI

- JEI pages have been ruthlessly culled to provide only helpful information, and
therefore doesn't have page-after-page of buckets or fuel cells.
- Some categories in JEI have been disabled as they are effectively duplicates
in this modpack.
  - The GregTech Distillation Tower (shown) and Immersive Engineering
Distillation Tower (hidden) categories are equivalent.
  - The Ex Nihilo Sieving (shown) and GregTech Sieves Sieving (hidden)
categories are equivalent. Sieving with an electric sieve takes 100 ticks and
requires 400 EU (or 396mB Steam with the Steam Sieve).

### Chisel

The Chisel is only craftable as a Tinkers' Construct tool. It can be made as
soon as flint is available.

### Ex Nihilo Creatio

The Hammer is only craftable as a Tinkers' Construct tool. It can be made as
soon as flint is available.

In addition, sieving recipes have been completely overhauled. Use JEI to keep on
top of it, or read the quest book carefully.

### Immersive Engineering

- The Alloy Kiln has been disabled.
- The Blast Furnace no longer requires a journey to the Nether
- Ore crushing with the hammer is disabled.
- Conveyors are craftable with just wood and GregTech tools.

### Industrial Foregoing

The use of Pink Slime has been removed entirely, and neither Liquid Meat nor ore
fermenting is part of the mod pack.

### Storage Drawers

Non-framed drawers are disabled, requiring you to use a Framing Table to create
drawers that you can interact with directly.

### Super Factory Manager

**TODO**: Unknown.

### Tinkers' Complement

- The High Oven is disabled.

### Tinkers' Construct

- The smeltery is completely disabled, you must use the meltery and alloy tank
from Tinkers' Complement to access metal tools.
- The Seared Tank is similarly disabled, and cannot be used to store large amounts
of liquids.
- The Seared Furnace has also been disabled, to incentivise use of other furnace
options, such as external heaters from Immersive Engineering.
- Various casts have been added to allow you to make GregTech tools out of
molten metals more easily (the tool must still be crafted through normal methods
in most cases).

## Requirements

- This modpack should run with 3GB RAM allocated on most setups.
