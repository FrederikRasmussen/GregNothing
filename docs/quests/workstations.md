# Manual Workstations

You will need various workstations to craft all you need during the game. These
workstations range from the standard humble Workbench and Furnace, to a full
Tinkers' Construct setup, the Forestry Worktable, Tinkers' Complement Melter and
Alloy tanks, as well as various other machines as you begin to progress into GregTech.

This chapter is decidedly not about automation, but rather the little manual
things that you won't need to do often, but you'll want to be convenient when
you do it.
