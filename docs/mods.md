# Mods to investigate

## Hooked

This mod should let the player engage in creative building exercises with a
minimum of fuzz. It could take the place of flight for the early game.

## Discord Integration

I cannot recall the name of the mod (Discord Presence?), but I need to look
into integrating Discord with the game to give it a more complete feel.

## Loading Screen Tips

I just love these little pieces of motivation and clarification. Also gives
me something to do when sitting at the lappy, unable to do big stuff.
