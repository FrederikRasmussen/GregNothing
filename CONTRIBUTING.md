# Contributing Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to contribute to this project, if they have something they
would like to change or improve. It is generally easier to maintain overview of
contributions if an appropriately named issue is opened in the issue tracker
along with the contribution. Putting `[CONTRIBUTION]` in your issue title will
make it easy to find.

## Contributing Assets (Scripts, Textures, Models, Quests, Configurations)

If you know how to use Git and GitHub, it is preferred that you create a fork of
the project and post a Pull Request with your changes, linking to the issue
related to your contribution.

Your pull request should only have the changes necessary to implement your
contribution, and should include notes if there is more work needed to be done
before the contribution is complete.
(e.g. if you have added new textures, and they aren't in the right directory
yet, or a configuration somewhere needs to be changed. If you do not know where
that configuration option is, that's okay, just note it in your pull request.)

If you do not know how to operate with Git and GitHub and create a Pull Request,
you are free to upload your files and link to them in your issue. I will do my
best to implement the contribution, assuming it is acceptable within the pack's
overall theme.

## Contributing Discussion

Another important aspect of any project is discussion and creative feedback.

Please create issues discussing potential enhancements and dreams you might have
for the modpack, if you wish to share them with the world. I highly recommend
that you add `[DISCUSSION]` to your issue so people will know it is a place to
talk about the could-be and might-be that is in the future of the pack.

## Thank You

For considering to contribute - or contributing something, I would like to thank
you in advance. This modpack can only be the best it can if we collaborate on it
as a group project.
